# short-term-memory-test
This is a short-term memory test based on the Schuhfried test. It is designed to be a fun project to practice programming skills using Pygame.
https://marketplace.schuhfried.com/en/visged this is the official test

Please note that this test is not in any way a replacement for the original test. The scoring system implemented in this project is rudimentary and does not reflect the actial scoring system used in the official test, i also cut alot of aspects of the original test as this is just supposed to be the main exercise to practice with.

The main goal of this project is to practice coding and work on slightly larger projects. The code may not be optimal or follow best practices, as it is a learning exercise. The comments are also subpar as this is the first code I have tried to implement them in and get a feel for what what needs documentation and what doesnt

I would greatly appreciate any feedback on how to improve myself and my coding skills. As this is my first significant project, I understand that there may be areas for improvement, both in terms of code quality and overall design. Any comments, suggestions, or advice would be highly valuable to me. Thank you in advance for taking the time to provide feedback!
